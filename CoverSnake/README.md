# Cover Snake v 1.0

This is a single player game. The game consists of surface size
of the browser window, the enemy in the form of floaters and the player in the form of a snake. The player controls a snake using the keyboard. Every movement leaves behind a trail and that the snake increases. Player movement of the snake draws a line across the rink and when combined some margin, concludes a specific area. This area uncovers an area that was at the beginning of the game completely covered and the enemy in this area can no longer obtain. In addition to the edges, the player can combine and has exposed surfaces. The player has to uncover as much of the hidden surfaces. Inside the game is moving enemy that can bump into a player. If that happens, the game ends (or take one life players).
